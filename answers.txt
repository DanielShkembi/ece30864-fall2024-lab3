Non-agile development's pros are that it has clear expectations [1] and clear responsibilities [2] within the project which essentially puts a lot more emphasis on tasks for specific people and makes them focus on documentation.
The cons of non-agile development are that they are not flexible [1] and require lots of in between steps like approval, which makes non-agile development slow [2].
Agile development's pros are that it is very flexible [1] (since it is fast moving), and has consistent delivery of products [2] every 2-4 weeks. 
The cons of agile development are that large projects would fail due to too much flexibility and not enough structure [1] and the documentation is done during the project which results in time management issues [2].
